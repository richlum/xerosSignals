to rerun section 2.5 tests, 
	make clean; make; make beros
to rerun other tests
	make clean; make test ; make beros

some of the other tests require user input.  
Some of the tests included in the report maybe 
commented out of the code from running as a result of
trying to capture printed output for each of the test cases.

I had some troubles with a number of of by one type errors in 
working with the process_keys method to handle the keyboard buffer,
to application buffer and detection of newline, ctld or full application
buffer to trigger notifies.   I believe I have all the bugs worked out
and it should work as expected.
